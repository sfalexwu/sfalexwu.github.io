Wordpress is used by 25-35% of all websites online today. They have the biggest market share amongst all other Content Management Systems. People use Wordpress because it is easy to setup, the community is strong with a lot of Wordpress developers and there is a huge plugin library to add any feature you want to your site. However, as you may know, the most popular doesn't always equate to the best. 

I specialize in web development for marketing, and a trend I see amongst other developers is the rise of the static site generator. Popular static site generators include Jekyll, Hugo, and Middleman. These static site generators are perfect for marketing websites and blogs. I'm currently using Jekyll for this blog. The only downside I see currently is you need to be at least somewhat technical to set up a Jekyll site and edit it. But, the good news is, I'm seeing many tools recently that is making it easier for non-technical people use static sites. Tools such as https://forestry.io/, https://www.contentful.com/ or http://prose.io/ that lets you create content like blog posts with a GUI like Wordpress. Let's face it, once you have a marketing site up, you don't really need to change it all that much, and if you want to do A/B testing there are tools like Optimizely that can change your site easily using their interface. I think the only things preventing a faster adoption of static sites for marketing websites and blogs  is education. As developers we need to educate our marketing peers about the greatness that is static site generators.

* Usually cheaper to host<br/>
* Simpler and cleaner architecture <br/>
