lead-text: Stop trying to make web development in marketing the same as in the engineering department
---
Whether you are a web developer in your marketing department or you're in the engineering department building
something for marketing. We have to stop thinking there is a one size fits all scenario for your web dev workflow.
Marketing usually moves at a faster pace with lots of things constantly changing. It is not the ideal
environment for a web developer that is more structured and process driven. In marketing you have to be prepared for
when speakers to your events drop out and you need to update your site. Or when your event venue has reached capacity
and you need to immediately shut off the registration. You can't wait, and go through the same processes as
engineering to get the job done. Don't get me wrong, I believe in version control and QAing in my workflow. But, you
have to approach it with a mindset to embrace the chaos that marketing can be.

Marketing projects are usually smaller in scope; like emails and landing pages. Marketing automation
 software has tools to store your emails or landing pages separate from your main marketing website. This is good
 because your assets are completely self contained and you won't have to worry about it breaking
 other areas of your site.

Any good marketer likes to test things like their CTA, copy and images. They need multiple versions of the same email
 or landing page. If they are constantly testing, they don't have time to wait for the developer to test
 everything the same way they would do in engineering.

Marketing has tight deadlines and sometimes timing can make all the difference for conversions. That's why I believe
in progressive enhancement. Think of websites and landing pages as living documents. We are not in the age of the
printing press where once somethings printed, we are stuck with that print until that piece of paper decomposes.
Things change, what might be true one day can be completely different the next. What we put out now can always be enhanced
and updated in the future.

The reality of web assets in marketing is that they can be dated. We can build something, only to see it disappear a
week later. Marketing requires fresh content to be pushed out to be relevant and attract eyes. So would it
make sense to spend a significant amount of time and resources to build something out that will be used only once for
 the course of a week or month? That's why I think the project manager will have to think about your ROI when they
 start a web project. The goal of the page or email is to capture leads, the web developer's job is to make the content
 accessible so people can consume the information easily on mobile, desktop etc. Would it make sense to spend 8 hours
  to fix a small rendering bug on a form input field for desktop users still on IE 8, when you know that accounts
  for 1% of your traffic? Note that the form input will still function, but it might not look the greatest for those
  1% of users. Or should we use that 8 hours to develop something else that can lead to even more leads instead of
  trying to squeeze the last drop of juice out of dried lemon for those 1% of users.
